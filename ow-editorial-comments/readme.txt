Oasis Workflow Editorial Comments helps you to add contextual comments to your post.

== Description ==
The add-on allows you to select a word or phrase or paragraph and provide comments for the selected text. Envision this to be similar to "add comments" in Microsoft Word. Just like "Word", you select a text in the post content area, click a contextual comment icon in the WYSIWYG editor. 
This will open up a popup to add contextual comment for the selected text.
The contextual comments get attached to the post and are visible right inside the "Edit Post" page allowing the users better control and viewing of editorial comments.
The sign off comments will also start appearing in this widget allowing the users to view the comments and act on it in a more efficient manner.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin zip file to your desktop
2. Upload the plugin to WordPress
3. Activate your license by going to Workflows --> Settings --> License
4. Start adding contextual comments during your editorial review process.
